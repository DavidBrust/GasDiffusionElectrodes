# GasDiffusionElectrodes
Project package for implementation of 1D, multiphysics simulation of gas
diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for CO2 electrolysis.
The simulation will utilize the finite volume method as implemented in the
[VoronoiFVM.jl](https://github.com/j-fu/VoronoiFVM.jl) package.
The code development takes place in Pluto notebooks, located in the notebooks 
subfolder.
